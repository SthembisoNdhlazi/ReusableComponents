A Module that contains most of my resusable components.

The idea is to eventually move away from having views and components in my main app and have them in this repo, then i can just import this repo and use them
So far, this repo has the following components:
- Side bar component: A side bar view that shows categories on the left hand side at a 90 degree angle and a view on the right hand side
- Item list view component: A component that shows a list of items and takes in any view that conforms to ItemDetailView to be used as a detail view.
- More coming soon...
